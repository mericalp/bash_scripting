# Write a function called analyse_string that returns the number of 
# special characters (#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~), words,
# and, total characters (all letters and special characters minus 
# whitespaces) in a string. Return everything in a dictionary format:

# {“special character”: “number”, “words”: “number”, “total 
# characters”: “number”}

# Use the string below as an argument:

# “Python has a string format operator %. This functions 
# analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g. "spam=%s 
# eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2) evaluates to "spam=blah eggs=2".
