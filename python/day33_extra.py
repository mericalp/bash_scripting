# You want to implement a code that will search for a number in 
# a range. You have a decision to make as to whether to store the 
# number in a set or a list. Your decision will be based on time. 
# You have to pick a data type that executes faster.
# You have a range and you can either store it in a set or a list
# depending on which one executes faster when you are searching 
# for a number in the range. See below:
# a = range(10000000)
# x = set(a)
# y = list(a)
# Let’s say you are looking for a number 9999999 in the range 
# above. Search for this number in the list and the set. Your 
# challenge is to find which code executes faster. You will pick the 
# one that executes quicker, lists, or sets. Run the two searches 
# and time them.

import timeit
# Testing the speed of execution in a set
speed_test = '''
a = range(1000000)

i = 999999
