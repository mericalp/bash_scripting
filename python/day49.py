# Create a Database
# For this challenge, you are going to create a database using 
# Pythonâ€™s SQLite. You will import SQLite into your script. 
# Create a database called movies.db. In that database, you are 
# going to create a table called movies. In that table, you are 
# going to save the following movies:
# year      title               genre
# 2009      Brothers            Drama
# 2002      Spider Man          Sci-fi
# 2009      WatchMen            Drama
# 2010      Inception           Sci-fi
# 2009      Avatar              Fantasy
# a) Once you create a table, run a SQL query to see all the 
# movies in your table.
# b) Run another SQL query to select only the movie Brothers 
# from the list.
# c) Run another SQL query to select all movies that were 
# released in 2009 from your table.
# d) Run another query to select movies in the fantasy and 
# drama genre.
# e) Run a query to delete all the contents of your table.

import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect('movies.db')
cur = con.cursor()
# Creating a table in the database
cur.execute('CREATE TABLE movies(year,title, genre)')
# Creating a variable of all the movies
movies = [(2009, 'Brothers', 'Drama'),
    (2002, 'Spider-Man', 'Sci-fi'),
    (2009, 'WatchMen', 'Drama'),
    (2010, 'Inception', 'Sci-fi'),
    (2009, 'Avatar', 'Fantasy')]
cur .executemany('''INSERT INTO movies VALUES(?, ?, ?);
''', movies)

# commit and close
con.commit()
con.close()
