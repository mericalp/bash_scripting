# Write a function called create_user. This function asks the 
# user to enter their name, age, and password. The function 
# saves this information in a dictionary. For example, if the use 
# enters name as Peter, age - 18 and password - love. The 
# function should save the information as: {'name': 'Peter', 
# 'age': 18, 'password': 'love'}
# Once the information is saved. The function should print to the 
# user that - "User saved. Please login"
# The function should then ask the user to re-enter their name 
# and password. If the name and password match with what is 
# saved in the dictionary, the function should return "Logged in 
# successfully". If the name and password do not match with 
# what is saved in the dictionary, the function should print
# ('Wrong password or user name. Please try again'. The 
# function should keep running until the user enters correct 
# logging details.
