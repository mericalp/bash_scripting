# Write a function called translate that takes the following 
# words and translates them into pig Latin.
# a = 'i love python'
# Here are the rules:
# 1. If a word starts with a vowel (a,e, i, o, u) add ‘yay’ at the 
# end. For example, ‘eat’ will become ‘eatyay’
# 2. If a word starts with anything other than a vowel, move 
# the first letter to the end and add ‘ay’ to the end. For 
# example, ‘day’ will become ‘ayday’.
# Your code should return:
# iyay ovelay ythonpay
