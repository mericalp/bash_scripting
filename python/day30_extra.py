# You work for a local school in your area. The school has a list of 
# names of students saved in a list. The school has asked you to 
# write a program that takes a list of names and sorts them
# alphabetically. The names should be sorted by last names. Here 
# is a list of names:
# [‘Beyonce Knowles, ‘Alicia Keys’, ‘Katie Perry’, ‘Chris 
# Brown’,’ Tom Cruise’]
# Your code should not just sort them alphabetically, but it should 
# also switch the names (the last name must be the first). Here is 
# how your code output should look:
# ['Brown Chris', 'Cruise Tom', 'Keys Alicia', 'Perry Katie', 
# 'Knowles Beyonce']
# Write a function called sorted_names.

def sorted_names(names):
    names=sorted(names)
    #print(names)
    new_list=[]
    for i in names:
        #print(i.split(" ")[1])
        new_list.append(i.split(" ")[1]+" "+i.split(" ")[0])
    print(sorted(new_list))



names=["Beyonce Knowles", "Alicia Keys", "Katie Perry", "Chris Brown", "Tom Cruise"]
sorted_names(names)
