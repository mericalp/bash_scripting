# Create a Flask App
# In this challenge, you will get to create an app using Flask. 
# Flask is a Python web framework. Learning to build websites
# with Flask is a very important skill to have if you want to get into 
# web development. You will build an app using Python, HTML,
# and CSS. I recommend using Visual studio code for this 
# challenge. You can still use whatever code editor you are 
# comfortable with. You are going to create an app with two pages, 
# the home page and the about page. Your website will have a 
# navigation bar, so you can move between the home page and 
# the about page. It will have a background image. The image in 
# the project is from Hasan Albari from Pexels.
# Below is what you should make:

from flask import Flask, render_template

# instantiating flask app
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template ('home.html')

@app.route("/about")
def about():
    return render_template ('about.html')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
