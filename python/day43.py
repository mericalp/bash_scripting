# Write a function called student_marks that records marks 
# achieved by students in a test. The function should ask the user 
# to input the name of the student and then ask the user to input 
# the marks achieved by the student. The information should be 
# stored in a dictionary. The name is the key and the marks is the 
# value. When the user enters done, the function should return a 
# dictionary of names and values entered.
