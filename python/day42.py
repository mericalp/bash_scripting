# Write a function called spelling_checker. This code asks the
# user to input a word and if a user inputs a wrong spelling it
# should suggest the correct spelling by asking the user if they
# meant to type that word. If the user says no, it should ask the
# user to enter the word again. If the user says yes, it should
# return the correct word. If the word entered by the user is
# correctly spelled the function should return the correct word.
# Use the module textblob.

    while True:
        word = input('Enter a word : ')
        # checking if the input word is correct

            # suggesting the correct word to the user
            question = input(f'Did you mean '
                            f'{TextBlob(word).correct()}?. '
