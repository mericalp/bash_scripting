# Create a function called save_emails. This function takes no
# arguments but asks the user to input email, and it saves the
# emails in a CSV file. The user can input as many emails as they
# want. Once they hit ‘done’ the function saves the emails and
# closes the file. Create another function called open_emails.
# This function opens and reads the content of the CSV file. Each
# email must be in its line. Here is an example of how the emails
# must be saved:
# jj@gmail.com
# kate@yahoo.com
# and not like this:
# jj@gmail.comkate@yahoo.com

mail_list = []
choice = input("""please enter your choice:
1- enter mail
2- display mail lists
: """)

if choice == "1":
    save_emails()
elif choice == "2":
    open_emails()


def save_emails():
    while True:
        email = input("please enter your email : ")
        if email == "done":

            mail_list.append(file)
            file.close()
            print(mail_list)
